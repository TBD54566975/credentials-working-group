- Frank: trust list - something in a verifiable data registry?
    - Gabe: yes, one of the documents
    - Daniel:
        - something you can host/discover from a dWeb node
        - e.g. look at first degree of connections, compile, walk outward and build organic trust
    - Frank:
        - published via DWN instead of a central registry. good way to bootstrap
        - Daniel: publish who you trust for what purposes
        - Gabe:
            - discoverability of trust lists vs looking at a single one from a DWN
